I am a Quantitative and Computational Biology PhD Candidate in [Ankit Patel's](https://ankitlab.co/) group at Baylor College of Medicine and Rice University

Currently, I am studying how to generate robustness models of visual perception. Particularly, I work on understanding how different model parametrizations can induce different implicit regularizers during training, and if this regularizer produce models that generalize better to random and adversarial noise. In addition, I work on understanding neurally consistent neural networks, which are trained to maximize similarity to neural recordings. This is while been part of the NINAI Team , which is a group of neuroscientists, physicists, computer scientists and mathematicians with a goal of advancing machine intelligence through neuroscience.

I was previously a research technician at Harvard University. I obtained my undergraduate degree from Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru. I am very grateful to have worked under some excellent mentors:

- [Gabriel Kreiman](http://klab.tch.harvard.edu/), Harvard University

- [Andreas Tolias](https://toliaslab.org/), Baylor College of Medicine
