**Key Contributions-**
+ Extracted the sentiments from the Insurance Claim Denial Letters by using DeepMoji, an attention based residual text classifier that is capable of generating
a rich representation of a given input text and also produces probability scores for 64 emojis. 
+ Transforming a text with low compassion score to a new text with higher compassion score by applying style transfer, but at the same time keeping the original 
content of the text intact. This step is a work in progress. 

Worked on a Document Form Digitization project in the healthcare domain where the objective is to segment all the fields present in the document form and
then extract the text as a key-value pair.
